# Git

* I'm hoping you have all heard of Git if not find @coridrew or @dahlbyk!
* They each have a Git session on Wednesday.

---
# Bundler

* > Bundler provides a consistent environment for Ruby projects by tracking and installing the exact gems and versions that are needed.


* > Bundler is an exit from dependency hell, and ensures that the gems you need are present in development, staging, and production. Starting work on a project is as simple as bundle install.

^ For the most part it is a nice tool, like any tool without proper use it can
cause much pain and suffering.

---
#Setting up an Development Environment
* Setup local machine?

^ You are going to need: Ruby, Ruby Gems, Rails, Bundler, Git all on your local machine

---
#Setting up an Development Environment
* Create a VM?

^ A little more isolated but still the setup process is going to take some work

---
#Setting up an Development Environment
* Use <insert hot new provisioning> technology

^ Again isolated but a poo storm

---
#Setting up an Development Environment
* Cloud IDE
 * [https://c9.io/](https://c9.io/)

^ This requires not much effort

#Which one is for me?

and how much time you want to spend getting things going.
